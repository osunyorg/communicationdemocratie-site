  The foundation of Communication and democratie springs from an analysis of the historical role of communication activities, as well as from the recent policy failures regarding the regulation of lobbying and advertising activities in France and in Europe.

summary: >-
  The organization Communication and democracy (Communication et démocratie) was founded in July 2021 by Alan Ouakrat, a researcher and teacher, Céline Réveillac, a militant communication expert, and Renaud Fossard, a social activist specialized in advocacy, with the support of 15 other qualified personalities who participated in its constitutive assembly.<br>This initiative springs from an analysis of the historical role of communication activities in the political development of our societies, the discussion leading to the drafting of the founding manifest of our organization, a few months later. Another catalyst was the recent policy failures regarding the regulation of lobbying and advertising activities in France and in Europe.

        <p> The organization Communication and Democracy (Communication et démocratie in french) was founded on July 8,2021 by the researcher and teacher Alan Ouakrat, the activist communication expert Céline Réveillac and the social activist Renaud Fossard, following the constitutive General Assembly that brought together 18 qualified personalities.</p><p>This initiative springs from an analysis that emphasizes the need for citizen debate around the necessary policies to reform the activities of communication and influence sector in general (see <a href="https://www.communication-democratie.org/en/l-association/texte-fondateur/" target="_blank">Foundingmanifest</a>), in line with a strong historical trend. It was also born out of a more specific immediate context: that of the recent conclusion of the "Programme Système publicitaire et influence des multinationales" or "SPIM" program, and out of the ongoing failure of the process to reform the regulatory framework regarding advertising, as discussed within the Climate Resilience Act, voted in 2021.</p>

            Renaud Fossard

          description: >-
            Renaud Fossard is a political analyst and a communicator. He is executive director of the association Communication and democracy (Communication et Démocratie).<br><br>Renaud was initially awarded a License’s degree in European and International Law from the University of Aix-Marseille and a Master's degree in Political Science from Grenoble Institute of Political Studies. Between 2009 and 2015, he worked as an advocacy officer for various organisations in France and Latin America that fight tax evasion by multinational corporations.<br>Thanks to this experience, he has been able to observe the decisive role played by the communication and influence activities of major corporations in preserving economic models that are predatory for human beings and the environment, maintaining an unsustainable consumerist way of life, influencing the media and capturing political decision-making processes. In 2015-16, Renaud went back to the university and obtained a Master’s degree in Corporate Communication at CELSA, a communication and journalism school that is part of the Sorbonne University in Paris. He then sets up the "SPIM programme" (french acronym for advertising system and influence of multinationals) which he ran for 4 years to produce expert reports on the issues involved in regulating communications activities. This programme will lead to the publication of a landmark report on these issues in 2020 entitled "Big Corpo".<br><br>The following year, Renaud co-founded the association Communication and democracy with Alan Ouakrat and Céline Réveillac, in order to provide civil society and public debate with a key player, able to act on the regulation of communication activities.

      The political context when the association was launched

        <p> Drafted during the proceedings of the Citizen's Climate Convention (CCC - <i>Convention citoyenne pour le climat</i>), which began in October 2019, and published in the press a few weeks before the CCC published its own conclusions in June 2020, the "Big Corpo" report directly contributed to the emergence of a public debate on the issues surrounding the need to regulate advertising, promotional marketing as well as the struggle against greenwashing. </p><p>Public awareness regarding these issues by civil society, public opinion and part of the professional communications sector was further raised by the inclusion of this agenda of reforms in the parliamentary debates regarding the "Climate and Resilience" Act. Despite this, however, in the end, the final version of the Act resulted in numerous compromises and setbacks by the majority in power regarding the need to regulate the activities of the commercial communication sector. </p><p>This failure was also in line with a more general dynamic of lack of ambition by the public authorities - or even lack of political debate - on the issues concerning the regulation of communication in the wider sense, and in particular issues like "360° lobbying" and the impact of advertising on the media and the Internet, at French as well as European levels.</p><p>In this context, the conclusion of the SPIM program in the second half of 2020 prompted a certain number of citizens from different backgrounds to take the initiative, at the beginning of 2021, to create an organization entirely dedicated to the analysis of and advocacy on matters of communication and influence by large corporations and organizations: "Communication et démocratie" was born in the summer of the same year.</p>
