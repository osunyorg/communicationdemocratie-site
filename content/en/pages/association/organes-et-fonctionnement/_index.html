    Governing bodies and functioning of the organization
  summary: >-
    <p>"Communication et démocratie" is an incorporated society according to the French law of 1901 (Association Loi 1901).  In this section you will find its statutes, an overview of its main governing bodies and its modus operandi as well as the members of the Board of Administration, the Bureau and the Secretariat. </p>
  body: >-
    <p>Functioning of the organization  <br>   <br>According to its statutes adopted on July 8, 2021, the organization <br>"Communication et démocratie" is made up of its members, <br>qualified personalities who hold membership in the organization. They <br>have professional qualifications and/or acquired skills that can <br>contribute, directly or indirectly, to the achievement of the <br>organization's objectives. The members meet in a General Assembly at least once <br>a year to discuss and vote on the general orientations of the <br>organization. They elect the members of the Board of Administration <br>for a two-year term, half of which is renewed each year. The Board of <br>Administration takes the appropriate decisions to implement the <br>general orientations defined by the General Assembly, and focuses on <br>the political and strategic issues of the organization. Members may <br>also meet in thematic or functional working groups, which report to <br>the Board. The members of the Board of Administration appoint a <br>Bureau, which is supported by a permanent Secretariat, currently <br>composed of one person, the Delegate General, who is employed full <br>time. The Bureau works more closely with the Secretariat, handles <br>human resources issues, follows up on more technical issues and <br>prepares the activities of the Board of Administration.  <br> The organization's activities are financed by <br>its members and donors as well as by financial partners, which can be <br>public actors or private foundations (excluding corporate-led <br>foundations). To date, most of the organization's funding comes from <br>the "Charles Léopold Mayer" and "Un Monde par Tous" <br>foundations. The drafting of the report " La <br>communication commerciale à l'ère de la sobriété " <br>in 2022, based on an academic study, was co-financed by the French <br>agency ADEME. The <br>share corresponding to the financial support received by members and <br>donors currently constitutes a small part of the <br>organization's budget, but this source of funding is expected to grow <br>in the coming years.</p>  <p>   <br>Statuts associatifs de Communication et démocratie</p>  <p> Members of the Board of administration 2025-2026  <br>  </p>  <p>After working for a number of NGOs, in 2006 he founded l'agence RUP (a communication agency for associations).
